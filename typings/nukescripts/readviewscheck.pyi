""" Check for multiple views in files when a read node is created, by
looking for a VIEW_NAMES entry in the node's metadata.
Most file types won't specify views but EXR/SXR and potentially other
files may do.
Registers for callbacks when a Read node is created, or its 'file' knob
is changed.  If there are multiple views, and they do not exist on the
root node, the user is asked if they should be created.
